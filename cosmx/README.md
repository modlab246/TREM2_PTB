# Viz protein channels 

This is just a simple Jupyter notebook example of how to read the CosMx protein channels in and construct an image (sample images on Zenodo) 

1. Define fovs, channels, scale
2. Create zarr matrix
3. Load in tiff files
4. Color map, clipping (what is minimum and max value detected)
5. Build composite

The fov sets are from the fovs below
